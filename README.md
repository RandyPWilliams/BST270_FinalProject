# BST270_FinalProject


The aim of this project is to reproduce the data visualizations and critique the reproducibility for the article, "Be Suspicious Of Online Movie Ratings, Especially Fandangoâ€™s", which was published by FiveThirtyEight (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/fandango-movies-ratings/).
The workflow for creating the visualization are found in the RMarkdown file BST270_FinalProject.Rmd.

## File List
1) BST270_FinalProject.Rmd: This is an RMarkdown file containing the code for the independent project.
2) BST270_FinalProject.pdf: This is a pdf file containing the output of the RMarkdown file for the independent project.

## Data Overview
The data that I used for this project was uploaded from FiveThirtyEight's github repository. 
The Rmarkdown file downloads the data directly from [FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango).
The data for every film pulled from Fandango on Aug. 24, 2015 can be downloaded from this [FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango) (use `fandango_scrape.csv`). 
The data pulled on Aug. 24 2015 for every film that has a Rotten Tomatoes rating, a RT User rating, a Metacritic score, a Metacritic User score, and IMDb score, and at least 30 fan reviews on Fandango can be downloaded from the [FiveThirtyEight GitHub repository](https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/fandango) (use `fandango_score_comparison.csv`).
